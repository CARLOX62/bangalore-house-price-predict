## 🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CARLOX62/bangalore-house-price-predict.git
cd bangalore-house-price-predict

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If no requirements.txt, manually install libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc

3️⃣ Run the Project

You can either:

 1. Run the Jupyter Notebook (price.ipynb) for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
 2. Or run the main script:
    python main.py

📊 Features

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
✅ Exploratory data analysis
✅ Model training (e.g. Ridge Regression)
✅ Price prediction using trained model
✅ Visualizations (optional)

🛠️ Usage

 1. Update the dataset (Cleaned_data.csv) if needed.
 2. Retrain the model using main.py or reuse the existing model (RidgeModel.pkl).
 3.Predict new prices.

📝 Notes

  1. The .ipynb_checkpoints/ folder contains notebook auto-saves (ignore).
  2. .pkl is a serialized model using Python’s pickle
