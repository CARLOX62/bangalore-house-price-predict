# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using machine learning models. It uses historical housing data and features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and more to estimate the price of a property.

## 📂 Project Structure

.
├── BHP.csv # Original dataset
├── Cleaned_data.csv # Cleaned dataset after preprocessing
├── main.py # Main Python script for training and predicting
├── price.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and model development
├── RidgeModel.pkl # Trained Ridge Regression model

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CARLOX62/bangalore-house-price-predict.git
cd bangalore-house-price-predict


2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional: If no requirements.txt, manually install libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

3️⃣ Run the Project
You can either:

Run the Jupyter Notebook (price.ipynb) for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

Run the main script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
📊 Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Model training (e.g. Ridge Regression)

Price prediction using trained model

Visualizations (optional)

🛠️ How to Use
Update the dataset (Cleaned_data.csv) with new entries if needed.

Retrain the model (main.py) or reuse the existing model (RidgeModel.pkl).

Run predictions on new data.

📝 Notes
The .ipynb_checkpoints/ folder contains auto-saved notebook checkpoints and can be ignored.

.pkl file is a serialized machine learning model using Python’s pickle.
